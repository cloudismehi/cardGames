# card games
this is a project to make card games. 

all the card images are on the asset folder - from here, a bunch of card games could be made. 

### Roba Pila

game logic established - need to work on connectivity, and animation fluidity. Also need to update layout so it looks cuter
especially when the cards on the table count exceeds more for some number that makes them start overlapping - this overlap problem 
causes them to be unreliably picked when you're clicking for gameplay 

Additionally, I need to set up my app wrapper for use on macOS computers - for easier play-testing 

### Dependencies 
- Raylib
